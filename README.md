# sh_rag

This repository contains a simple Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) example written in Python. The example uses TF-IDF for document search and YandexGPT for answer generation. A small Telegram bot demonstrates how to interact with the RAG pipeline.

## Requirements

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## CLI usage

Place your `.txt` documents inside the `docs/` directory and run:

```bash
export YANDEX_TOKEN=your_yandex_token
export YANDEX_FOLDER_ID=your_folder_id
python rag.py "your question here"
```

The script retrieves relevant documents using TFâ€‘IDF and sends the question with the found context to YandexGPT.

## Telegram bot

Set the following environment variables before starting the bot:

```bash
export YANDEX_TOKEN=your_yandex_token
export YANDEX_FOLDER_ID=your_folder_id
export TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_telegram_token
```

Then run:

```bash
python bot.py
```

The bot will reply in Telegram with answers generated by YandexGPT based on your documents.
